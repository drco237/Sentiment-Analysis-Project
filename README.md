# Sentiment-Analysis-Project
02.27.2024 Python Sentiment Analysis of Twitter Data

In this project, I developed Python 3 code that cleans, analyzes, and visualizes Twitter data provided by the University of Michigan. 

The goal of the project is to run the Twitter data through a sentiment analyzer function along a list of key positive and negative words identified in "Mining and Summarizing Customer Reviews" of the Proceedings of the ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining. 

After cleaning the data and passing it through the functions, I export the data to a csv file and create a scatterplot visualization along two axes, Number of Retweets and Net Sentiment Score.
